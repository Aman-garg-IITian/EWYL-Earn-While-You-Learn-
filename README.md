**INTRODUCTION**
"Earn While You Learn" is essentially a job portal designed to make job hunting and learning go
hand in hand. It's like a virtual space where students and teachers from IIT Jammu can meet up
for job opportunities within the institute. Professors and staff can easily post jobs on this website,
and students can check them out and apply. It's a win-win â€“ students get a chance to earn while
studying, and teachers find talented folks within the IIT community. It's all about making job
searches simpler and more connected to the school experience.
